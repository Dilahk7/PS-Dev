# Mock Repository

This repository is a mock repository mirroring content from various private sources. The primary objective of this repository is to simulate the commits originating from  private sources, reflecting the developer's work. Each commit in this repository is masked with a corresponding junk file, ensuring that the actual content remains secure and confidential.

All the contents generated are junk files. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the original content while still showcasing the developer's progress and activity.

This repository has been automatically created using Miro Mannino's script, which handles the creation and synchronization of these mock commits.

If there is a gap between the current day and the last commit, it is most likely because the developer hasn't synced it yet.
